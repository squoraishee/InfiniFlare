# InfiniFlare

Astronomical Object Detection is an important field of research that enables astronomers to study the universe more effectively by automating the process of identifying and analyzing objects in large-scale astronomical surveys. The InfiniFlare project is aimed at developing a CNN to detect and classify different types of astronomical objects, such as stars, galaxies, and supernovae.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:
